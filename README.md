# GalaxyBuds2-Leak
I just found a beta-release of the new unreleased Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 plugin on Samsung's update servers. I've tried to collect all interesting data I was able to retrieve.

## Resources

There are pictures of the earbuds in various colors: black, white, gray/green, violet, and yellow

The APK did not contain any battery case images (except simple line-art that matches the Buds Pro and Buds Live case)

## New features

* The app adds an option to enable "ANC with one earbud". It is located in the hearing enhancements fragment; however, it is currently invisible. It will probably be available if the app detects that the connected earbuds have a certain firmware that supports it installed. 
* The app also contains code for an interactive tutorial that is supposed to help the user wear the earbuds correctly (similar to the Buds Live)
* You can now enable/disable 'single-tap', 'double-tap', 'triple-tap', and 'touch-and-hold' touch-actions individually, instead of locking the whole touchpad.

## Battery capacity

| Earbuds  | Case     |
| -------- | -------- |
| 61mAh    | 472mAh   |
| 5V, 0.2A | 5V, 0.6A |

(See screenshots below)

## Comparison with the Buds Pro

- No 360Â° sound feature
- No 'outside double-tap volume controls' for now. While there's still logic for it in the Bluetooth backend present, this feature was completely stripped from the UI code. They might re-introduce this later with a firmware and app update.
- ANC and Ambient sound are available as well
- ANC does not have the "High/Low" option anymore. You can't fine-tune it; however ANC can now be used even if only one earbud is connected.
- Very precise touch options (read more below; they might add this to the other models as well)

## Screenshots

I'm patching the app on-the-fly to simulate a pair of Buds2. The battery dashboard has been redesigned and is much simpler. Some settings like the Bixby Voice-wakeup and 'ANC with one earbud' are invisible, I didn't bother patching all of those in as well, but they exist.

And here are some other various screenshots. The Equalizer settings are the same, and the 'Find my earbuds' page has been redesigned a little bit.
